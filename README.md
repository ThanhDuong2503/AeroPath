Hi guys!

I hope this app will help you to prepare your flights. 
You can create your flight route with individual waypoints and save them in your database for later usage. 
The flight route will be displayed on a map for better visualisation.
You will also be able to get current weather data for your flight area.

Fly save and happy landings! :)


To start the dev server go to the frontend folder and run npm install and npm start
